## Overview
We preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implement multiple machine learning algorithms to predict online food orders. The best-performing model is used for making predictions based on user input.

## Dataset
The dataset includes historical order data with features like age, monthly income, marital status, family size, etc.

## Algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- SVM
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- AdaBoost Classifier

## Results
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy and is used for predictions.

## Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
